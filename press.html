<h3>bio</h3>
<p>Rat Dreams plays panoramic folk-rock rooted in storytelling and fragmented by electronic sounds, noise, and improvisation. Alt-country, old time, slowcore, 90s rock, minimalism, and ambient influences can be heard throughout their work.</p>

<p>The band includes Andrea Gutmann Fuentes of Cincinnati indie rock quartet The Ophelias and Dan Seibert and Jack Doran of Columbus singer-songwriter ensemble Hello Emerson. The’ve received airplay on WYSO in Yellow Springs, Ohio and KCRW in Los Angeles. They’ve shared the stage with The Ophelias, Another Michael, and Erisy Watt, among others. Their EP Six Postcards was featured in Bandcamp’s New and Notable.</p>

<p>Rat Dreams formed in autumn 2017 in Columbus, Ohio as primary songwriter Will Myers sought to find musicians to help complete a set of songs he recorded earlier that summer. They played their second show the same day Will received a diagnosis of a rare form of cancer. The album’s themes of catastrophic change and medical trauma turned out to be oddly prescient, and recording and mixing the album became a central part of Will’s coping and healing. The album was released in July 2018 as Not At Home.</p>

<p>Will’s experience of surviving cancer and the coalescing of the Rat Dreams into an active band led to a new set of songs, In December. The album explored themes of new love, loss, and memory with a newfound sense of togetherness. Facing the separation required by the covid-19 pandemic, Rat Dreams reimagined themselves with 2022’s Six Postcards, an EP of entirely instrumental music inspired by the environmental music of Hiroshi Yoshimura and the writings of Jewish-Marxist philosopher Walter Benjamin. The EP was recorded entirely remotely, with each musician performing at a different tempo, guided only by a field recording and the prior contributions of other musicians.</p>

<p>Rat Dreams’s upcoming album in the summer you dream of god is an anti-Americana opus inspired by Edgar Lee Masters’s Spoon River Anthology, Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk, and five years living in the foothills of Appalachia in Athens County, Ohio. A double album in five parts, in the summer you dream of god weaves together the mystic and the mundane in a series of vignettes in which a cast of characters recount their relationship to land and the ways that the land turned out to be something other than what they imagined. The album brings together instrumental freeform improvisation, singer-songwriter bedroom folk, and large-ensemble alt-country and indie rock to create a multifaceted portrait of people and place.</p>

<p>With in the summer you dream of god, Rat Dreams offers an album that gathers together the many past tendencies of the band into a comprehensive whole. This is the band at a new peak of musicianship, songwriting, and collective truth-seeking.</p>
